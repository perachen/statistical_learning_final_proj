\subsection{Motivation}\label{motivation}}

This project deals with the issue of social mobility in Israel.
\textbf{Social mobility} is the movement of individuals, families,
households, or other categories of people within or between social
strata in a society. It is a change in social status relative to one's
current social location within a given society. Because of the structure
of the population in our country I find this issue very interesting and
in this project I would like to find associative answers to the
questions\ldots\ldots\ldots..

\hypertarget{description-of-the-data-set}{%
\subsection{Description of the data
set}\label{description-of-the-data-set}}

The data is a survey conducted by \emph{The Central Bureau of Statistics
in 2018. The study participants are 7,500 people representing the
population in Israel aged 20 and over. I got the raw data set from
Central Bureau of Statistics.}

The data consist of 402 questions in the subject of Social Mobility. In
order to give description on the data set I divided the questions to 12
groups:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \uline{Details about household members} - questions about marital
  status, country of birth, age, sex, etc.
\item
  \uline{Details about apartment, car and Housekeeping} - Those
  questions focus on property, apartment ownership (and a number of
  owned apartments), ownership of a private vehicle (and a number of
  vehicles per capita in the household). Those questions also ask if is
  there an assistant or caregiver at home and for what purposes.
\item
  \uline{Positions on residence} - Description of attitudes regarding
  the living area, such as satisfaction with public transportation
  services, street security, air pollution, garbage collection,
  satisfaction from the relationship with neighbors, etc.
\item
  \uline{Health and lifestyle} - Questions that ask about the health
  background of the study participant, chronic diseases, disabilities,
  and whether there is difficulty in daily functioning.

\item
  \uline{Skills: Studies, languages, courses, military service and
  driver's license -} Questions about academic studies and professional
  training, number of years of schooling, education among the parents of
  the research participant and whether he did military or national

  what purposes.
\item

  employment, scope of work, job satisfaction, professional future (עתיד
  מקצועי), arrival at work (אופן וזמן ההגעה לעבודה), impact of change in
  family status, medical status or place of residence on employment,
  etc.
\item
  \uline{Vacation, contact with family and friends and volunteering -}
  Questions about social life, going out for fun and vacations,
  satisfaction and confidence in social relationships and contact with
  family members. In addition, questions about volunteering and
  contributing to the community.
